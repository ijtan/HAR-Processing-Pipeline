abstract = {Activity-Based Computing [1] aims to capture the state of the user and its environment by exploiting heterogeneous sensors in order to provide adaptation to exogenous computing resources. When these sensors are attached to the subject's body, they permit continuous monitoring of numerous physiological signals. This has appealing use in healthcare applications, e.g. the exploitation of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) in daily activity monitoring for elderly people. In this paper, we present a system for human physical Activity Recognition (AR) using smartphone inertial sensors. As these mobile phones are limited in terms of energy and computing power, we propose a novel hardware-friendly approach for multiclass classification. This method adapts the standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) and exploits fixed-point arithmetic for computational cost reduction. A comparison with the traditional SVM shows a significant improvement in terms of computational costs while maintaining similar accuracy, which can contribute to develop more sustainable systems for AmI. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {In the last decade, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has become a vibrant research area, especially due to the spread of electronic devices such as smartphones, smartwatches and video cameras present in our daily lives. In addition, the advance of deep learning and other machine learning algorithms has allowed researchers to use HAR in various domains including sports, health and well-being applications. For example, HAR is considered as one of the most promising assistive technology tools to support elderly's daily life by monitoring their cognitive and physical function through daily activities. This survey focuses on critical role of machine learning in developing HAR applications based on inertial sensors in conjunction with physiological and environmental sensors.},

abstract = {The ubiquity of smartphones and the growth of computing resources, such as connectivity, processing, portability, and power of sensing, have greatly changed people's lives. Today, many smartphones contain a variety of powerful sensors, including motion, location, network, and direction sensors. Motion or inertial sensors (e.g., accelerometer), specifically, have been widely used to recognize users' physical activities. This has opened doors for many different and interesting applications in several areas, such as health and transportation. In this perspective, this work provides a comprehensive, state of the art review of the current situation of human activity recognition (HAR) solutions in the context of inertial sensors in smartphones. This article begins by discussing the concepts of human activities along with the complete historical events, focused on smartphones, which shows the evolution of the area in the last two decades. Next, we present a detailed description of the HAR methodology, focusing on the presentation of the steps of HAR solutions in the context of inertial sensors. For each step, we cite the main references that use the best implementation practices suggested by the scientific community. Finally, we present the main results about HAR solutions from the perspective of the inertial sensors embedded in smartphones.},

@article{Cho2018,
abstract = {Human Activity Recognition (HAR) aims to identify the actions performed by humans using signals collected from various sensors embedded in mobile devices. In recent years, deep learning techniques have further improved HAR performance on several benchmark datasets. In this paper, we propose one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) for HAR that employs a divide and conquer-based classifier learning coupled with test data sharpening. Our approach leverages a two-stage learning of multiple 1D CNN models; we first build a binary classifier for recognizing abstract activities, and then build two multi-class 1D CNN models for recognizing individual activities. We then introduce test data sharpening during prediction phase to further improve the activity recognition accuracy. While there have been numerous researches exploring the benefits of activity signal denoising for HAR, few researches have examined the effect of test data sharpening for HAR. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on two popular HAR benchmark datasets, and show that our approach outperforms both the two-stage 1D CNN-only method and other state of the art approaches.},
