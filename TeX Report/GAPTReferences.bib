abstract = {Activity-Based Computing [1] aims to capture the state of the user and its environment by exploiting heterogeneous sensors in order to provide adaptation to exogenous computing resources. When these sensors are attached to the subject's body, they permit continuous monitoring of numerous physiological signals. This has appealing use in healthcare applications, e.g. the exploitation of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) in daily activity monitoring for elderly people. In this paper, we present a system for human physical Activity Recognition (AR) using smartphone inertial sensors. As these mobile phones are limited in terms of energy and computing power, we propose a novel hardware-friendly approach for multiclass classification. This method adapts the standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) and exploits fixed-point arithmetic for computational cost reduction. A comparison with the traditional SVM shows a significant improvement in terms of computational costs while maintaining similar accuracy, which can contribute to develop more sustainable systems for AmI. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {In the last decade, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has become a vibrant research area, especially due to the spread of electronic devices such as smartphones, smartwatches and video cameras present in our daily lives. In addition, the advance of deep learning and other machine learning algorithms has allowed researchers to use HAR in various domains including sports, health and well-being applications. For example, HAR is considered as one of the most promising assistive technology tools to support elderly's daily life by monitoring their cognitive and physical function through daily activities. This survey focuses on critical role of machine learning in developing HAR applications based on inertial sensors in conjunction with physiological and environmental sensors.},
