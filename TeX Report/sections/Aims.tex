The main objective our group aimed to accomplish was to understand and make use of deep learning and classical machine learning
techniques to correctly classify a number of stationary and moving activities in the UCI dataset \cite{Anguita2013}. We also aimed to build our own dataset,
consisting of many records of activities. We then wished to apply and evaluate the classification methods on our own database. The new
activities in our own dataset are laying, sitting, standing, walking straight, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, driving, jumping, swimming
and performing push ups.
