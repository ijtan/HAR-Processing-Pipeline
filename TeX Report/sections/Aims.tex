The objective of this project was to implement a mix of deep learning and classical machine learning techniques to correctly classify the UCI dataset \cite{Anguita2013} by following the Anguita et al.'s methodology.
Subsequently, a new dataset would be constructed which includes a number of additional activities not found in the UCI dataset.
Using this new dataset, the previously implemented techniques would be adapted to classify these new activities while maintaining high performance.
