\subsection{Support Vector Machines}
    Support Vector Machines (or SVMs) are a type of classifier used for classification and regression. SVM seeks to classify samples as different classes
    on a hyperplane in multidimensional space. The classification process generates multiple hyperplanes to find the one which minimises an error value.
    Generally, support vector machines are used for binary classification problems. However, they can be adapted to multiclass problems by converting
    or reducing them into a set of multiple binary classification problems. However some samples cannot be classified linearly, hence SVMs can also make
    use of kernels to transform non-linear space into linear space, which was proposed by Boser et al. \cite{Boser1992}.
