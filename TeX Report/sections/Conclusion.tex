In this project it was found that the SVM classifier achieved the best results from all the techniques used for both the UCI dataset and our dataset when considering all activities.
As shown in the evaluation section, the CNN implemented for static activity classification achieved near equal results.
Considering the fact that the CNN implementations required more time and effort to actually function as HAR classifiers, the results obtained are satisfactory.
Based on the results obtained, and the quality of the data constructed, the SVM classifier has shown to be the better performing classifier and ideal for HAR.

Future studies on this topic should ensure to collect larger volumes of human activity data, particularly if convolutional neural networks are to be used. Furthermore,
the techniques implemented can be adapted to a wider, more varied set of activities, such as cycling.
