\subsection{Feature Extraction}
    Excluding the label for each activity, each session in the dataset contains 589 features. These features were extracted by applying a number of different statistical
    measures to the different extracted signals in each sliding window.

    Each signal has the statistical measures in \ref{tab:table-1} applied to them.

    \subsubsection{Comparing different classification models}
        In total, four different classic machine learning classifiers were used on the dataset developed by Anguita et al \cite{Anguita2012}. These classifiers are Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes,
        AdaBoost, Stochastic Gradient Descent and a Support Vector Classifier. These were trained and tested using the respective datasets, and their accuracy,
        F-beta, precision and recall scores were recorded.
