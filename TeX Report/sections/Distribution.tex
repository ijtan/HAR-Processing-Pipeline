From there we distributed tasks and worked on the entire project together.
Below we have listed the section owners.

\begin{itemize}

    \item Jake Sant - Support Vector Machine \& Feature Extraction

    \item Aiden Williams - Convolutional Neural Network \&  Classical Machine Learning Comparison

    \item Ethan Zammit - App Development \& Data Processing
