Figure 1 above is the confusion matrix representing the accuracy of the classification of each activity as a percentage. The leading diagonal represents correctly labelled activities. Each activity group classified had an accuracy of 96\% or higher, with half activities being classified at an accuracy of 99-100\%.
1\% of driving activities were misclassified as sitting. This was to be expected as during driving sessions there were times (i.e. being stuck in traffic) where the driver was stationary and in the same position as that of someone seated down.
2\% of laying activities were misclassified as sitting, this is understandable as the two stationary activities have similar positions.
