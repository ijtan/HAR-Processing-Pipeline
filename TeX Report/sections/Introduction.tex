In this project we reviewed a number of published papers about human activity recognition and implemented a number of classical machine learning and deep learning classification techniques for the UCI dataset.
Then, we collected our own data by performing different activities across multiple sessions. We then implemented the classification methods that worked best for the UCI dataset \cite{Anguita2013} on this new dataset.
Finally, we compared the results for the different classifiers.
