In this project we reviewed a number of published papers about human activity recognition and implemented a number of classical machine learning and deep learning classification techniques for the UCI dataset.
Then we constructed our own dataset and implemented the methods that worked best for the UCI dataset on this new dataset.
Finally, we compared the results for the different data.
